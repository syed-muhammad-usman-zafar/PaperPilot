## üöÄ Features
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**
  - Modular agents for research extraction, writing, and citation.
  - Each agent's output is visually distinct and conversational.
- **Real Source Integration**
  - Fetches up-to-date research papers from Semantic Scholar using extracted keywords.
  - Summarizes abstracts and generates contextual, human-like draft paragraphs.
  - Academic-style citations referencing real, current sources.
- **Knowledge Graph (Preview)**
  - Tracks extracted research elements, sources, and draft content.
  - JSON preview for transparency and explainability.
- **Modern UI/UX**
  - Clean, modular Streamlit interface with tabbed workflow (Client & Backend views).
  - Centered branding with a paper airplane icon and tagline.
  - Expanders and clear visual hierarchy for a seamless experience.
- **Smarter Drafting**
  - Bullet-point summaries from real abstracts.
  - Draft paragraphs synthesize and contextualize cited work, avoiding redundancy.
  - Human-like, QuantaQuill-inspired writing style.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
1. **Prompt Extraction:**  
   Enter your research idea in natural language. The system extracts domain, keywords, methods, objectives, and key concepts.
2. **Drafting (AI Co-Author):**  
   The app fetches real papers, summarizes key findings, and drafts contextual paragraphs with proper citations.
3. **Knowledge Graph:**  
   All extracted elements and sources are tracked and previewed for transparency.

## üì¶ Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Streamlit
- Semantic Scholar API (for real research sources)
- Pandas

---

## üìù Example Use Cases
- Drafting full research papers with real, cited sources from a single prompt.
- Exploring how multi-agent AI can assist in academic writing.
- Demonstrating neurosymbolic, explainable AI for scientific communication.

---

## ‚ö° Current Status
- Core multi-agent, real-source, and drafting logic complete.
- Modern, modular UI/UX with dark theme and centered branding.
- Ready for further extension (validation agent, advanced knowledge graph, etc.).

---

## üöß Roadmap / Next Steps
- Add advanced knowledge graph visualization and reasoning.
- Implement validation and feedback agents.
- Support for more citation styles and export formats.
- Enhanced user customization and editing.
